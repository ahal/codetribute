  ## How Do I Get Started?

  Check out our list of [good first issues](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Contributor+OK+%F0%9F%A4%9D%22) on Github.
  Pick one that interests you and then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios#building-the-code) to build the project.


  ### How Do I Write the Code?

  All of the code is in the [Github repository](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios).
  To get started, fork that repository on GitHub, then clone the resulting forked repository to your computer.
  Before you change anything, run the tests to make sure everything is working.
  The repository's README file will describe how to set up and run tests.
  From there, follow the Github pull-request process: make your changes on a topic branch, and then create a pull request from that branch.
  The Internet is full of guides for this process, and of course we are happy to help as well.

  ## How Do I Get Help?

  The best place to talk about a bug or issue is in the comments.
  Don't be afraid to ask questions or describe how you are solving the problem.
  That way, anyone watching the bug can answer your questions or offer useful advice.

  We are also available on [matrix.io](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#firefox-ios:mozilla.org) in the `#firefox-ios` channel in the mozilla.org community.
